# CMSC-142

A CMSC 142 Laboratory employing the divide and conquer in solving the problems

1. Counting Inversion
Given an array of numbers , count the number of inversions in the array.
An inversion involves a pair (x,y) where index(x) < index(y) but value(x) > value(y) ;
that is, x appears before y, but x is a bigger number than y.

3. Hotter and Colder
Jack and Jill will play a game called Hotter, Colder. Jill chooses a number from 0 to 100 .
Jack will make repeated attempts to guess the number. For each guess, Jill will answer:
● hotter - if the current guess is closer to her number than the previous guess is
● colder - if the current guess is farther to her number than the previous guess is
● same - if the current guess is as far (to her number) as the previous guess is
For Jack’s first guess, Jill will just answer same , since there is no previous guess yet.
Write an algorithm that will guess the number and win the games faster ( fewer guesses ).
